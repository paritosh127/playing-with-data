I was wondering what is the most "cost efficient" set of foods to eat (while getting complete nutrition), from the things that I eat (I'm vegetarian but eat eggs). So I decided to use data analysis to figure this out!
Nutrition data was pulled from the NDB database (https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/).
Prices were taken from my local store and Amazon.
Results were a little surprising to me (check out the notebook for the results).
